# Setup
This platform does require Kafka to run. To simplify the process we have built in a scripts directory and all the needed scripts to enable users. We have also included the needed files within this repository, to limit external downloads. The scripts are done from the perspective of the user leveraging a Mac and setting it up within the home directory and able to start everything from it simply.
